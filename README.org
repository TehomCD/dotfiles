* DOTFILES

This is designed to bootstrap a clean install of macOS quickly.

** INSTALL

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# First, create an alias to support the dotfile git dir
alias gitdf='git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'

# Clone Dotfile Repo
git clone --bare https://github.com/rvalente/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles

# Checkout Dotfiles into your Home Dir
# NOTE: Either remove or move any conflicting dotfiles
gitdf checkout

# Thats It! Open a new Shell
#+END_SRC

** POST-INSTALL

Ensure you create a `~/.gitconfig.local` file with your username/email.
You do not want to have this located within the `.dotfiles` repo!

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[user]
	name = GIT_NAME
	email = GIT_EMAIL

[github]
	user = GITHUB_USERNAME
	token = GITHUB_TOKEN
#+END_SRC

** CREDITS

Thanks to [Smyck](http://color.smyck.org) for making a color scheme that doesn't suck.
